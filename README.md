## Prove Your AI's Reasoning to Regulators. Offline. Cryptographically.

For healthcare, finance, and legal AI systems that must demonstrate why they made each decision — without sending sensitive reasoning traces to third-party services.

## The Problem Regulators Actually Care About

Your AI makes a decision that impacts a customer. The decision is challenged.

**Lender:** "Why did you reject this applicant?"
**Doctor:** "Why did you recommend that treatment?"
**Lawyer:** "What's the basis for this legal argument?"
**Auditor:** "Prove this decision wasn't changed after the fact."

Request-level observability (OpenTelemetry, LangSmith, Langfuse, Datadog) remains essential for what happened in production. It does not, by itself, prove *why* an agent took a given decision path — or that the path has not been tampered with. For regulated workflows, that gap matters: sensitive reasoning often cannot leave your infrastructure.

DProvenanceKit answers the question regulators actually ask: **Can you prove, cryptographically, that your AI's reasoning was sound and hasn't been tampered with?**

---

## Why This Matters for Regulated Industries

### Healthcare
Your diagnostic-support AI recommends treatment. A patient sues. The hospital needs to show that the recommendation was based on the patient's actual symptoms and medical history—not a hallucination. A cryptographically signed trace is that proof.

### Financial Services
Your lending AI rejects an applicant. They file a fair-lending complaint. You need to prove the decision was based on relevant factors, not proxy discrimination. A verifiable reasoning chain is your defense.

### Legal
Your legal AI generates a brief with case citations. Opposing counsel challenges the citations. You need to prove every case actually exists and was correctly cited. The entire reasoning is signed so it can't be disputed.

### Insurance
Your claims AI approves or denies a claim. The customer appeals. Auditors want to see the decision tree. A provable reasoning path shows the logic was consistent and wasn't hidden.

### Government
Your AI processes FOIA requests or makes eligibility determinations. Citizens and auditors need to understand the reasoning. Local-first means no privacy concerns, and cryptographic signing means it's trustworthy.

## How It Works

**DProvenanceKit is not a SaaS platform. It's a local-first SDK.**

1. **Your AI system runs normally.** Everything stays on your infrastructure.

2. **Each decision is recorded locally.**
   - Every reasoning step
   - Every evidence used
   - Every tool called
   - Every intermediate result

3. **The trace is cryptographically signed.**
   - SHA-256 hash of the canonical reasoning path
   - ECDSA P-256 signature (Secure Enclave available on the Swift / Apple side)
   - Detached proof artifacts separate from trace data

4. **Auditors verify offline, without calling home.**
   - No external service dependency
   - No internet required
   - Proof that traces weren't modified in transit
   - Open-source verification code they can audit themselves

---

## Works with your observability stack

DProvenanceKit aims to be the local-first standard for **AI reasoning observability** — record, diff, attest, and CI-gate the decision path. It is built to sit **beside** OpenTelemetry, LangSmith, Langfuse, and Arize, not to replace them.

| | Platform / request observability (LangSmith, Langfuse, OTel, …) | DProvenanceKit |
|---|---|---|
| **Job** | Spans, dashboards, evals, production monitoring | Reasoning path, golden baselines, signed proof, CI gate |
| **Question** | What happened? | Did the decision path regress — and can we prove it? |
| **Where data lives** | Collector or hosted platform (by design) | Local-first; optional OTel ingest/export when you choose |
| **How they fit** | Keep using them | Add DPK next to them |

**Bottom line:** Use LangSmith, Langfuse, and OpenTelemetry for platform observability. Use DProvenanceKit when you need the reasoning layer to be queryable, diffable, attestable, and refused in CI when it drifts.

## Real Example: Legal Document Provenance

A law firm uses an AI to draft legal briefs.

**The problem:** Every citation must be verifiable. If the AI cites a case that doesn't exist, that's malpractice.

**How DProvenanceKit helps:**

```
1. Legal AI generates brief
2. Before export, every claim is verified:
   - "Does this case actually exist?" (checked against legal database)
   - "Is this statute current?" (validated against code)
   - "Is this quote accurate?" (matched against source)
3. The entire reasoning chain is cryptographically signed
4. Brief is exported with proof packet attached
5. If disputed, the firm can show:
   - "Here's the reasoning chain"
   - "Here's the signature"
   - "Auditors can verify it hasn't been tampered with"
```

```

You instrument your AI workflow. You establish baselines. You manage the governance policy.

**Best for:** Teams with internal compliance/audit expertise.

### Option 2: Governed AI Deployment Pilot ($4,500 one-time)

For organizations that want governance guidance + compliance audit:

**Includes:**
- **Instrumentation review:** Is this the right tracing for your compliance needs?
- **Baseline establishment:** What's the "golden" reasoning path your AI should follow?
- **Governance policy definition:** What counts as a regression? When do we alert? What's audit-worthy?
- **Compliance audit report:** Proof of your reasoning architecture for regulators.

**Does not include:**
- Recurring SaaS or managed service
- Code in your repository
- Ongoing support (scope separately as needed)

**Who this is for:** Chief Risk Officer, Compliance Officer, Audit Manager at a regulated organization deploying one specific AI workflow.

**Example scope:**
- Healthcare: Diagnostic-recommendation AI
- Finance: Lending decision AI
- Legal: Brief-generation AI
- Insurance: Claims-approval AI

**Timeline:** 30 days, delivered as a report.

## Getting Started

### For Open-Source Users

1. **Define your AI's critical decisions**
   - What reasoning steps must regulators see?
   - What evidence matters?
   - Where is liability highest?

2. **Instrument one workflow**

```bash
pip install dprovenancekit
# optional adapters:
# pip install "dprovenancekit[langchain]" "dprovenancekit[openai-agents]"
```

```python
from dprovenancekit import traced, record_event, traced_run

@traced
def check_credit(applicant):
    ...

@traced
def verify_income(applicant):
    ...

with traced_run(context_id="applicant_12345"):
    check_credit(data)
    verify_income(data)
    record_event("decision_made", {"approved": True})
```

See the catch immediately after installing:

```bash
dprovenancekit demo
```

3. **Establish a baseline**
   - Run your workflow multiple times
   - Pin a known-good run (`dpk record`)
   - Store the proof with the repo

4. **Gate future changes**
   - When you update the model, re-run
   - Compare new reasoning to baseline (`dpk compare` / `dpk gate`)
   - Diff shows exactly what changed
   - Decide: Is this safe to deploy?

5. **Verify with auditors**
   - Give them the proof packet
   - They verify offline
   - No internet, no vendor involvement
   - Proof that traces are authentic

Adapters for LangChain / LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, and OpenTelemetry ingest live in `dprovenancekit.integrations`. Details: [docs](https://dprovenance.dev) and the [OpenAI Agents listing](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/docs/tracing.md#external-tracing-processors-list).

### For Pilot Participants

1. Schedule a kickoff call
2. Define the scope (one AI workflow)
3. Provide your reasoning trace format
4. Receive governance policy + audit report
5. Keep the open-source tool, informed by compliance experts

## Technical Foundation

DProvenanceKit is built on proven infrastructure:

- **Recording:** Non-blocking writes with priority-aware backpressure
- **Storage:** WAL-mode SQLite (crash-safe, auditable)
- **Query language:** Temporal and structural reasoning patterns
- **Diffing:** Semantic alignment engine that detects regressions
- **Signatures:** Canonical encoding + ECDSA P-256 (Secure Enclave on the Swift side)
- **Verification:** Deterministic, offline, open-source
- **CI gate:** `dprovenancekit gate`, pytest `golden_trace`, and the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dprovenancekit-regression-gate)

**Cross-language:** Swift and Python implementations kept in sync by a formal conformance spec, not by hope. They produce byte-identical outputs for the same input.

**Battle-tested:** Reasoning observability in production at regulated organizations. Conformance suite validates correctness. Benchmark corpus tests edge cases.

---

## No Third-Party Dependencies

**Core (Python):**
```
sqlite3, contextvars, threading, json, hashlib, uuid, urllib
```

No pip dependencies in the core. Just Python's standard library. Requires Python 3.9+.

**Core (Swift):**
```
Foundation, CryptoKit, SQLite
```

No external packages. Native to macOS/iOS. Requires Swift 6.0.

**Why this matters for compliance:** Fewer dependencies = smaller attack surface = easier for auditors to review.

---

## Adoption Path

## Why This Exists

AI systems make decisions that affect real people. Regulators want to see the reasoning. Cloud-based observability platforms aren't designed for that job alone.

DProvenanceKit is built for teams that care about:
- **Privacy:** Data stays local
- **Auditability:** Reasoning is provable and verifiable
- **Liability:** Proof that the decision was sound
- **Compliance:** Evidence that regulators will accept

If your AI makes healthcare, financial, legal, or insurance decisions, you need this.
